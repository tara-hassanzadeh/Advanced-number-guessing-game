# 🎯 Advanced Number Guessing Game (Python)

This is an **improved and advanced version** of the classic Number Guessing Game previously built as a basic project.

In this version, the user selects a difficulty level, has a limited number of attempts, and receives interactive feedback. This project was developed to build upon the concepts used in the basic version.

## 📌 What's New Compared to the Basic Version

- Difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Random range based on difficulty
- Limited number of attempts
- Input validation with `try/except`
- Clean function-based structure
- Option to play again after each game

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Python functions
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`while`)
- Exception handling
- Random number generation
- Modular and reusable code design
