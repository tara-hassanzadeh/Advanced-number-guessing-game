# 🎯 Advanced Number Guessing Game (Python)

This is an **improved and advanced version** of the classic Number Guessing Game previously built as a basic project.

In this version, the user selects a difficulty level, has a limited number of attempts, and receives interactive feedback. This project was developed to build upon the concepts used in the basic version.
